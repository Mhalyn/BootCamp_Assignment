        The Atsuta Shrine, in the heart of the city of 
        Nagoya, is the most important Shinto shrine in 
        Japan, and attracts more than five million visitors 
        each year. Established in the first century, this 
        religious site is famous for its preserved Imperial 
        insignia, the "grass-mowing sword" 
        (kusanagi-no-tsurugi), one of only three in the 
        country.</br>
     
        Also of interest are its principal shrine, Hongu, 
        surrounded by an enclosing wall, and the 
        treasury with its numerous works of art, 
        including old and modern paintings, ceramics, 
        jewelry, and traditional masks. While in Nagoya, 
        be sure to also visit Nagoya Castle, a splendid 
        moated complex built in 1612 boasting a 
        48-meter-high main tower that is famous for 
        its two gilded dolphins (shachi), its museum 
        containing art treasures from the former palace, 
        and its spectacular views over the city and the 
        Nobi Plai63. <br><br>

        In 1893, it was remodeled using the Shinmeizukuri architectural style, the same style used in the building of Ise Shrine. Before a celebration in 1935, the shrine's buildings as well as other facilities were completely rearranged and improved in order to better reflect the history and cultural significance of the shrine.
        During the bombings of World War II, however, many of Atsuta Shrine's buildings were destroyed by fire. The shrine's main buildings, such as the honden, were reconstructed and completed in 1955.[2] Following the completion of these buildings, construction of other buildings continued on the shrine grounds. In 1966 the Treasure Hall was completed in order to house the shrine's collection of objects, manuscripts and documents.
